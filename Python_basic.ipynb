        "\n",
        "    -Python is a high-level, easy-to-learn programming language that people use to build all kinds of software—like websites, apps, games, data analysis tools, and even artificial intelligence systems. It was created to be simple and readable, which means even beginners can understand and start coding without getting overwhelmed.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    One of the main reasons Python is so popular is its clean and simple syntax. Writing code in Python feels almost like writing in English, which makes it great for learning and fast development. It’s also very versatile—you can use it for web development (using frameworks like Django or Flask), data science, automation, machine learning, and more.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Another big reason for its popularity is its huge community and libraries. No matter what you're trying to do, there's probably already a library or tool in Python to help you. Plus, if you ever get stuck, there are tons of tutorials, forums, and other people willing to help.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    In short, Python is popular because it’s easy to use, flexible, and supported by a strong community. It’s a great choice for beginners and professionals alike.\n",

        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -In simple words, an interpreter in Python is a program that reads and runs your Python code line by line.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    When you write Python code (like print(\"Hello World\")), the interpreter goes through it one line at a time, understands what it means, and then performs the action—like displaying the text on the screen.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Unlike some other languages that need to be compiled first (converted completely into machine code before running), Python doesn't need that. Instead, the interpreter handles it all during runtime, which makes it easier to test and see results quickly.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    So, you can think of the Python interpreter as the \"middleman\" that takes your code and tells the computer what to do, one instruction at a time.\n",

        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "    \n",
        "    -Pre-defined keywords in Python are special words that have a fixed meaning in the language. These words are reserved, which means you can't use them as variable names or identifiers in your code.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Each keyword plays a specific role in Python's grammar and is used to write instructions like conditions, loops, functions, etc.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    if, else, elif –> used for making decisions\n",
        "\n",
        "    for, while –> used for loops\n",
        "\n",
        "    def –> used to define a function\n",

        "    True, False –> used for boolean values\n",
        "\n",
        "    import –> used to bring in external code or libraries\n",
        "    \n",
        "    There are around 30+ keywords in Python (the exact number can change with versions). You can always see the full list using this command:\n",
        "\n",
        "    import keyword\n",
        "    print(keyword.kwlist)\n",
        "\n",
        "    In short, pre-defined keywords are the building blocks of Python code, and you should avoid using them for naming your variables.\n",

        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "    \n",

        "    \n",
        "    -In simple terms, mutability in Python refers to whether or not an object (like a list, string, or dictionary) can be changed after it’s created.\n",

        "    \n",
        "    You can add, remove, or change elements in a list after it's created.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    This makes lists very useful when you need a collection that can be updated.\n",
        "    \n",

        "    \n",

        "    \n",
        "    Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    This makes tuples faster and safer, especially when you want to protect data from accidental changes.\n",
        "    \n",

        "    \n",
        "    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",

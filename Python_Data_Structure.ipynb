        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    -1) What is a Dictionary in Python?\n",
        "    \n",
        "    A dictionary is like a real dictionary. You look up a word (called a key) and get its meaning (called a value).\n",
        "    \n",
        "    In Python, dictionaries store data as key-value pairs.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    2) How is the Data Stored?\n",
        "    Python dictionaries use a special system called a hash table to store the data.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    This means:\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Each key is converted into a unique number (called a hash).\n",
        "    \n",
        "    This hash helps Python quickly find where to store or retrieve the value.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Example:\n",
        "    \n",
        "    student = {\n",
        "    \"name\": \"Rahul\",\n",
        "    \"age\": 21,\n",
        "    \"college\": \"UPES\"\n",
        "    }\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Here:\n",
        "    \n",
        "    \"name\" is a key, \"Rahul\" is the value.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    \"age\" is a key, 21 is the value.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    \"college\" is a key, \"UPES\" is the value.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    3) Key Rules:\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Keys must be unique – You can't have two keys with the same name.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Keys must be immutable – Like strings, numbers, or tuples. Lists can't be used as keys.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Values can be anything – Strings, numbers, lists, even other dictionaries.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    4) Accessing Data\n",
        "    \n",
        "    You can get the value by using the key:\n",
        "    \n",
        "    print(student[\"name\"])  # Output: Rahul\n",
        "    \n",
        "    5) Behind the Scenes (How it works internally)\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Python runs a hash function on the key.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    This hash tells Python where to store the value in memory.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    When you access a key, Python quickly goes to that memory location and gets the value.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    This makes dictionaries very fast for lookups.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    -Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Because sets and lists are made for different purposes. Here's when and why you'd choose a set over a list:\n",
        "    \n",
        "    1) To Remove Duplicates Automatically\n",
        "    \n",
        "    A set only stores unique items.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    If you add the same item more than once, it keeps just one copy.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Example:\n",
        "    \n",
        "    my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]\n",
        "    \n",
        "    my_set = set(my_list)\n",
        "    \n",
        "    print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}\n",
        "    \n",
        "    So, if you only care about unique values, use a set.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    2) For Fast Membership Testing\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Checking if something exists in a set is much faster than in a list, especially when the data is large.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Example:\n",
        "    \n",
        "    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
        "    \n",
        "    print(3 in my_list)  # Slower\n",
        "    \n",
        "    my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
        "    \n",
        "    print(3 in my_set)   # Faster\n",
        "    \n",
        "    So, if you need to check if something exists often, use a set.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    3) To Perform Set Operations\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Sets let you easily do things like:\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Union (combine sets)\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Intersection (common elements)\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Difference (what's in one but not in the other)\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Example:\n",
        "    \n",
        "    a = {1, 2, 3}\n",
        "    \n",
        "    b = {3, 4, 5}\n",
        "    \n",
        "    print(a & b)  # Output: {3} (Intersection)\n",
        "    \n",
        "    You can't do this directly with lists.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    4) When Order Doesn't Matter\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Sets are unordered → They don't remember the order of elements.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Lists are ordered → They keep elements in the same order you added them.\n",
        "    \n",

        "    -1) What Does Immutable Mean?\n",
        "    Immutable means something cannot be changed after it is created.\n",
        "\n",

        "    3) Why Did Python Make Strings Immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Reason 1: Performance and Memory Efficiency\n",
        "\n",
        "    Strings are used a lot in programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Making them immutable helps Python reuse memory (internally it stores only one copy of identical strings).\n",
        "\n",
        "    This makes the program faster and uses less memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Reason 2: Security and Safety\n",
        "    If strings could change, they could break code accidentally.\n",
        "\n",
        "    For example, if one part of your program is using a string like a password, and another part changes it by mistake, it would create bugs.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Immutability protects the data from being changed by accident.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Reason 3: Hashing and Dictionary Keys\n",
        "    Strings are often used as keys in dictionaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Dictionary keys need to be constant and unchangeable, so they can be located quickly using hash values.\n",
        "\n",
        "    If strings were mutable, their hash value would change, and dictionaries would break.\n",
        "\n",
        "    4) But Can You \"Change\" a String?\n",
        "    Not directly—but you can create a new string from the old one.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    -What Are Dictionaries and Lists?\n",
        "    \n",
        "    A list is an ordered collection of items where each item is accessed by its position (index).\n",
        "\n",
        "    A dictionary is an unordered collection of items where each item is accessed by a key (like a name tag).\n",

        "    Advantages of Dictionaries Over Lists:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1) Faster Lookups\n",
        "\n",
        "    In a list, to find a value, Python may have to search through every item.\n",
        "\n",
        "    In a dictionary, you can instantly get the value using a key.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example:\n",

        "    print(students[\"roll2\"])  # Directly access with key\n",
        "\n",
        "    2) More Meaningful Access\n",
        "\n",
        "    With lists, you use numbers to access items.\n",
        "\n",
        "    With dictionaries, you use meaningful keys, which makes your code easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "    You just use the key (like \"name\" or \"age\"), and Python gives you the value.\n",
        "\n",
        "    4) Useful for Structured Data\n",
        "\n",

        "    Lists are better for simple, ordered data (like scores or names).\n",
        "\n",
        "    5) Easier Updates\n",
        "\n",
        "    You can easily update, add, or delete values in a dictionary using keys.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "    1) You Only Need Ordered Data\n",
        "\n",
        "    Lists maintain the order of items.\n",
        "\n",
        "    If the order matters (like to-do lists, recent activities, rankings), a list is the better choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    shopping_list = [\"milk\", \"bread\", \"eggs\"]\n",

        "    3) You Want to Store Duplicate Values\n",
        "\n",
        "    Lists allow duplicates, while dictionaries do not allow duplicate keys.\n",

        "    4) You Need to Access Data by Position\n",
        "\n",
        "    Lists let you access items using their index (0, 1, 2, …).\n",

        "    -1) Why Are Dictionaries Considered Unordered?\n",
        "    \n",
        "    In older versions of Python (before version 3.7):\n",
        "\n",
        "    a) Dictionaries did not keep the order in which you added items.\n",
        "\n",
        "    b) This means if you added 5 items, and then printed the dictionary, they might show up in a completely different order.\n",
        "\n",
        "    This happened because dictionaries were built for fast access, not for order.\n",
        "    Internally, Python uses hash tables to store key-value pairs, and these are focused on speed, not order.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2) What About Now?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Since Python 3.7, dictionaries do maintain insertion order by default.\n",
        "\n",
        "    So, if you write:\n",
        "\n",
        "    my_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}\n",
        "\n",
        "    print(my_dict)\n",
        "\n",
        "    Output will be:\n",
        "    {    'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n",
        "\n",
        "    But even now, Python still calls dictionaries \"unordered\" because:\n",
        "\n",
        "    a) The main focus is on key-based access, not the order.\n",
        "\n",
        "    b) You shouldn't rely on the order unless you're using Python 3.7 or later.\n",

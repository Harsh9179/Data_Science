        "\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods). It emphasizes the use of classes and objects to design applications and promotes code reusability, scalability, and maintainability.\n",

        "**2. What is a class in OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects (instances) will have. Classes encapsulate data and behaviors into a single unit.\n",

        "**4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation**\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features to the user. Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class), and restricting direct access to some components.\n",

        "**8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation in Python is achieved by defining class attributes as private using a single underscore `_` (protected) or double underscore `__` (private). Access to these attributes is controlled using getter and setter methods.\n",
